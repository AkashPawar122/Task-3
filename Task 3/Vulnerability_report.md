## ðŸ”¶ Medium Vulnerability Highlight

### 1. SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted
- **Severity**: Medium
- **CVSS Base Score**: 6.5
- **Details**:
  This issue occurs when the serverâ€™s SSL certificate cannot be traced back to a trusted public certificate authority. It may be self-signed, expired, or improperly configured.

- **Why it Matters**:
  Users accessing services using such certificates may fall prey to man-in-the-middle attacks as they cannot verify the authenticity of the server.

- **Solution**:
  The system should use a valid and trusted SSL certificate. If possible, purchase or generate a proper certificate from a recognized CA.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Additional Noteworthy Issues (Informational)
- **SMB Signing Not Required**
  - SMB services did not enforce message signing, increasing MITM attack risks.

- **TLS and SSL Weaknesses**
  - Multiple issues found in how TLS/SSL are handled.

- **Open Ports Detected**
  - Many services were listening on common ports, which could be hardened.

---

## ðŸ§  Observations
- Even with a relatively short scan duration, several minor and medium-risk vulnerabilities were flagged.
- Most of the vulnerabilities are related to outdated configurations or default services.
- Nessus provided in-depth remediation tips that are actionable.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Learnings
- Understood the importance of regular system scans.
- Learned about common network service misconfigurations.
- Understood how SSL trust chains work and why they matter.

---

## ðŸ›  Recommendations
- Replace or configure SSL certificates properly.
- Enable SMB signing.
- Review open services and close those that are unused.
